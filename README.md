E-Commerce Recommendation System with Flask & Machine Learning
Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and serve a product recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. The system combines machine learning with a Flask web app to deliver personalized product suggestions, improving user experience and engagement.

What It Does

Content-based filtering: Recommends products with similar attributes.

Collaborative filtering: Learns from user–item interactions using matrix factorization.

Hybrid approach: Blends multiple strategies for higher accuracy.

Multi-model pipeline: Supports different ML models for varied recommendation needs.

How It Works

Data Preparation – process user behavior and product metadata.

Model Training – build content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommenders.

Flask Integration – expose recommendations via simple web routes.

User Experience – browse products, receive tailored suggestions, and give feedback.

Tech Stack

Python, Flask – web serving

pandas, NumPy – data handling

scikit-learn, TensorFlow – ML models

Docker (optional) – containerized deployment

Quickstart
